SECTION 2 

Section Evaluation:

1. 'department_name = NULL' cannot work as expected because Null can't be 
used with '='. In SQL, 'IS NULL' is used to check for NULL values.

2. The 'OR' section can't be properly processed unless it grouped differently.
E.g. (department_name = 'Cardiology' OR department_name IS NULL)

3. When working with multple tables, you should specify which table a column
belongs to by specifying each column with an 'id' or name. This makes it clear 
which table the column is from 

4. Limit 1, only lets you see one patient 


Suggestions:

1. Use EXISTS instead of '=(SELECT...)'

2. Ensure indexes on admissions.department_id and admissions.admission_date

3. Change =NULL to IS NULL

4. Improve Limit to however many patients you need to see (I used 5 as an example)
